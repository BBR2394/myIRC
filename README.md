# MyIRC

## introducing 
This is "myIRC" project, it is one of our network project at my school EPITECH

## How to start it
After cloning the repo, you need to compile the two binary :
- one for the server
- one for the client
For that you just need to execute gcc with the Makefile doing
```
make 
```
If you need to recompile it, to do it in the clean way, you can execute :
```
make re
```

### server part
To start the server you need to provide an available port, and execute:
```
./serveur [port number]
```

### client part
```
./client [server IP] [port number]
```
